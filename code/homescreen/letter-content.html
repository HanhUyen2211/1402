                    Although Scott said it didn't matter to him, he knew deep
                    inside that it did. They had been friends as long as he could
                    remember and not once had he had to protest that something Joe
                    apologized for doing didn't really matter. Scott stuck to his
                    lie and insisted again and again that everything was fine as
                    Joe continued to apologize. Scott already knew that despite
                    his words accepting the apologies that their friendship would
                    never be the same.

                    It wasn't supposed to end that way. The plan had been
                    meticulously thought out and practiced again and again. There
                    was only one possible result once it had been implemented, but
                    as they stood there the result wasn't anything close to what
                    it should have been. The fog was as thick as pea soup. This
                    was a problem. Gary was driving but couldn't see a thing in
                    front of him. He knew he should stop, but the road was narrow
                    so if he did, it would be right in the center of the road. He
                    was sure that another car would end up rear-ending him, so he
                    continued forward despite the lack of visibility. This was an
                    unwise move.

                    Debbie had taken George for granted for more than fifteen
                    years now. He wasn't sure what exactly had made him choose
                    this time and place to address the issue, but he decided that
                    now was the time. He looked straight into her eyes and just as
                    she was about to speak, turned away and walked out the door.

                    Colors bounced around in her head. They mixed and threaded
                    themselves together. Even colors that had no business being
                    together. They were all one, yet distinctly separate at the
                    same time. How was she going to explain this to the others?
